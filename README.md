# model-picker

Stop overpaying for AI models. Find the cheapest model that's smart enough for the job, and the cheapest provider to run it on, from live [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai) benchmarks pulled through [Firecrawl Alexandria](https://firecrawl.dev).

```
$ model-picker pick --min-score 45 --vs claude-fable-5-1

score  $/task  speed     model                         vs Claude Fable 5.1
46.3   $0.13   48 tok/s  MiMo-V2.6-Pro (Xiaomi)         87% of the score, 57x cheaper
47.8   $0.21   55 tok/s  GPT-6.1 Sol (Medium) (OpenAI)  90% of the score, 36x cheaper
50.2   $0.32   57 tok/s  GPT-6.1 Sol (High) (OpenAI)    94% of the score, 24x cheaper
...
```

Every row is a model nothing else beats on both score and cost. If a model isn't listed, something cheaper is at least as smart.

## Setup

1. Get a free Firecrawl API key at [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev) and `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...`
2. Clone and install: `git clone <this repo> && cd model-picker && bun install`

### As a Claude Code skill

```
/plugin marketplace add <this repo>
/plugin install model-picker@model-picker
```

Then ask Claude Code things like "which model should I use for my support bot?" or "find me a cheaper provider for GLM-5.3".

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pick [--min-score N] [--max-cost USD] [--open] [--claude-code] [--vs slug]` | Cheapest models at or above a score, optionally compared with the one you use now. `--claude-code` limits it to the Claude models and effort levels Claude Code runs natively |
| `providers <slug> [--sort cost\|speed]` | Every provider serving one model, by cost per task or speed |
| `search <name>` | Find a model's slug. Also lists models Artificial Analysis hasn't measured a cost for yet |

Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output.

**Score** is the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index (0-100; today's best models score about 55-58). **$/task** is what it costs to run one Intelligence Index task, which accounts for how many tokens a model actually burns, not just its price per token.

## Cost

A `pick` uses 20 Firecrawl credits and a `providers` lookup 5. Results are cached for 12 hours, so repeat runs are free.
